## What is it?

Mob programming is a practice where the whole team comes together to implement a feature or piece of functionality

## Why use it?

Ensures the whole team understands how a specific feature is implemented or problem is solved. It can also be a quick way to onboard new team members.

## How to do it?

Mob programming involves the whole team working on a single piece of functionality at the same time. The easiest way to mob program is to have one team member driving a laptop that is connected to a large screen or projector.

The whole team then implement the feature together by talking through the development together.
